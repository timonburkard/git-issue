# Description

Currently IDs are generated by increment. We loop through the list of directories (`.gitissues/issues/`) and the new ID is max + 1

When working in a big team, this might create a lot of git merge conflicts.

We could provide alternative ID generation approaches, configurable in `config.yaml`.

- `id_generation` = 
  - `sequential`: max + 1 (default) u32
  - `random`: random u32
  - `timestamp`: creating timestamp in unix time or since 2025-01-01 u32
