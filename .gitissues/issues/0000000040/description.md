# Description

For sprint/release planning it could be useful to have dedicated field(s).

Alternatively, the user can use labels for this. But I would maybe be nice to have a separate milestone field, e.g., just a simple string "v1.0".

Or, more advanced, as Azure DevOps supports it:
- Found in Release
- Required in Release
- Resolved in Release
