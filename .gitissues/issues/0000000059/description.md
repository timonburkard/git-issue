# Description

This is how the markdown is currently structured, which is generated by the `show` command:

```md
<!-- READ-ONLY VIEW -->

# Issue #XX -- Here the title of the issue is shown and it can be pretty long

## Description

...
```

As the title of the issue is already shown at the beginning of the markdown file, I don't think it makes sense to duplicate the info also in the metadata table.

This also has the advantage that usually the metadata table will be less wide.

# Repro Steps

Check markdown shown for `git issue show <id>` command

# Expected Behavior

Title only shown once in the beginning; not again in the metadata table

# System Info

v0.7.2
