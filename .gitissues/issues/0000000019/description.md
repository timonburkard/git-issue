# Description

Issues are currently not related to code changes (git commits)

Well, they are because they co-exist in the git repo and thus, with `git blame` it is very easy to figure out when an issue got resolved. -- So if a team has the convention of putting issues to resolved in the PR that fixes them, they do have traceability.

But maybe there are other workflows, for which it would be nice if we have a list of related commits per issue (in meta data)?
