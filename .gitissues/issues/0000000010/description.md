# Description

Not so important once we have #3 implemented, but still, this would only provide the possibility to search in meta fields (especially title).

But it will not provide possibility to search through the descriptions. That's why I think we need it.

> Note, there is a similar issue: #54. However the current issue is more like a new `grep` feature, which can find all search results in the description and lists them with context, while #54 is an extension of the filter capability of the existing `list` command.
