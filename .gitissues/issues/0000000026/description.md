# Description

Currently the command is:

```
git issue new <title>
```

It would make sense to give the possibility to provide all meta field values (except `state`), if the user wants to:

```
git issue new <title> [--type <type>] [--labels <labels>] [--assignee <assignee>] [--priority <priority>] [--due-date <due-date>]
```
