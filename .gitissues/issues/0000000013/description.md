# Description

We currently have:

```
git issue set <id> --labels <add_labels>
```

with adds new labels (which do not yet exist; i.e., duplicates are prevented) to the issue meta field.

However, there is no command to remove existing labels.

E.g., something like this:

```
git issue remove <id> --labels <remove_labels>
```
